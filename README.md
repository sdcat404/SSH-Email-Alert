4: At the bottom of the page, select App passwords.
5: Enter a name that helps you remember where youâ€™ll use the app password.
6: Select Generate.
7: To enter the app password, follow the instructions on your screen. The app password is the 16-character code that is generated on your device.

Good job!

# But, SDcat404. This doesn't work on my machine!
After testing this out, it wont work on all distros, and yes this includes macOS (sorry not sorry) 
On most linux systems the SSH logs are kept in "/var/log/auth.log" but on macOS its kept in "/var/log/system.log"
So have a play around on line '9' and see what works for you.
